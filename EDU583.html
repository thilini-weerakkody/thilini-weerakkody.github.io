							<p>I attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill majoring in Human Development and Family Studies with a minor in Medical Anthropology. I am passionate about serving black and brown women from marginalized communities.  Longterm, I hope to pursue a PHD in neuropsychology in order to serve families, like my own, who have been transformed by traumatic brain injury and disability. The needs and experiences of black and brown women are particularly underrepresented in the white, cis-male dominated field of Neuropsychology. I hope to provide emphatic, identity informed care to patients as well conduct research on the intersection of race, identity, mental health, and neuroscience throughout my career.</p>

            <h3>Career Portfolio</h3>
 	<h4>Identity, Values, and Career Reflection</h4>
		  	<p> I am the ENFJ Personality type which is labeled as the protagonist. The description offered by the personality type describes ENFJ’s as passionate leaders. Furthermore, looking at my DISC assessment, my dominant function is Influence which means I primarily try to inspire and persuade individuals. The ENFJ profile addresses a similar tendency but uses the word “charisma” to explain it. I think this does speak to my leadership style as an individual because I firmly believe that all people are abundant and capable. To me, leadership is based in service—a dedication to ensuring people have the information to make an informed decision and the resources to act on their choices. I have worked and love leadership roles were I as a mentor can help others see their true power—it is one of my greatest passions in life. <p/>   
	<h4>Vision Board</h4>
	  		<p> The following image is a vision board of my value systems, dreams, priorities, strengths and weaknesses. The board acts as a visual repersentation of my values and path in life. </p>

	<h4>Elevator Pitch (As shown above)</h4>  
	  		<p> Hi, My name is Thilini. I attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill majoring in Human Development and Family Studies with a minor in Medical Anthropology. I am passionate about serving black and brown women from marginalized communities.  Longterm, I hope to pursue a PHD in neuropsychology in order to serve families, like my own, who have been transformed by traumatic brain injury and disability. The needs and experiences of black and brown women are particularly underrepresented in the white, cis-male dominated field of Neuropsychology. I hope to provide emphatic, identity informed care to patients as well conduct research on the intersection of race, identity, mental health, and neuroscience throughout my career. <p/>

	<h4> Internship Goals and Learning Plan </h4> 
			<p> Throughout my internship, I would like to gain insight about the common techniques and approaches used in neural brain imaging and neuroscience research. I would love to leave my internship with a firm understanding about the feild of neuropsycology in order to be an informed student as I enter masters. Tangibly, my goals will be to publish a paper and give a presentation at a conference. I plan to learn by both meeting my goals, asking questions, and facilitating consistent communication with my mentor. </p>

            <h3>Training and Professional Developement Plan</h3>
		 <h4>Affirmative Action Isn’t Reverse Jim Crow: Asian Americans and the Reconstruction of White Entitlement w/ Iyko Day (9/30/2020)</h4>
		  	<p>  I attended this event because anti-racism is important to me. In order to incorporate anti-racism into my career and academic work I have to understand how my identity as an Asian person interacts with racism. During the event, I learned about the current sentiment of Asian Americans and the discussions around affirmative action. The speaker was powerful. I learned about vocabulary and approaches to navigating this conversation.  <p/>   
          	 <h4>Embody Carolina Training for Eating Disorders (09/16/2020)</h4>
		  	<p>  This workshop taught me about how to be a better ally and support system for someone with an eating disorder. I learned about the specific disorders that my future clients and community may experience and how to identify them. This will be useful as I work and serve individuals who may experience eating disorders, making me a more informed practitioner.  <p/>   
		 <h4>UNC Institute for Best Practices CECMH Motivational Interviewing Training (9/21/2020)</h4>
		 	<p> This was a two-day training on motivational interviewing which was recommended by one of my mentors. It was incredible experiencing which taught me how to use and build on individuals’ strengths to encourage positive behaviors in my clients. This skill not only strengthens my resume, but also allows me to be a better, more motivational leader/provider.  <p/>   
		 <a href="images/Weerakkody.pdf" target="_blank" class="button">Certification</a>
		 <h4>Dismantling Racism in Academia-Journal Club & Discussion Group (10/28/2020)</h4>
		 	<p> I signed up for this group in order to have conversations about racism and academia because antiracism is a major value system of mine and I intend to work in academia. Unfortunately, I thought that this conversation was not nuanced enough, and I didn’t feel like I joined a deeper, BIPOC based understanding; however, I hope to explore other opportunities for this knowledge.  <p/>    
	 	 <h4>The Future of Anti-Racist Activism at UNC (10/14/2020)</h4>
			<p> I attended this event because of the powerful, student directed film, “Silence Sam” and the discussion that followed. It was important for my professional development because I was an activist during the Silent Sam movement, and I intend to speak about this experience in my graduate school essays/interviews. I learned about the connections between Silent Sam, current issues with corona, and current black student sentiment.  <p/>
